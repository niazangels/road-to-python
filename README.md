# Road to Python
A collection of wild things I stumbled across that made me go ðŸ¤© or ðŸ¤¯

### [Why would you use `NotImplemented` instead of `NotImplementedError`?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/879005/1112611)
`NotImplemented` signals to the runtime that it should ask someone else to satisfy the operation. In the expression  `a == b`, if `a.__eq__(b)` returns  `NotImplemented`, then Python tries `b.__eq__(a)`. If `b` knows enough to return `True` or `False`, then the expression can succeed. If it doesn't, then the runtime will fall back to the built-in behavior (which is based on identity for `==` and `!=`)

### [@staticmethod is messing up my `super()` calls](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26788214/super-and-staticmethod-interaction)
What most people are expecting when they see `super(X)` is what Python gives you if you do `super(X, X)`.

### [What's a pythonic replacement for switch/case in Python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60208/replacements-for-switch-statement-in-python)
From simple dictionary with `.get()` method to really creative ideas like a context manager. [Here's one more method](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/410692/)

The creator of Flask doesn't due to [backpressure](https://medium.com/@jayphelps/backpressure-explained-the-flow-of-data-through-software-2350b3e77ce7)

### [How to unit-test decorated functions?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30327518/how-to-unit-test-decorated-functions)
Split your decoration into two
```python
def to_string(value):
    return str(value)

def stringify(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args):
        return to_string(func(*args))

    return wrapper
```

### [How can I undo `git reset --hard HEAD~1`?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5473/how-can-i-undo-git-reset-hard-head1)
```
git reflog
git reset --hard <sha1 of desired commit>
```

### [Why the heck is `np.nan != np.nan`?](https://towardsdatascience.com/navigating-the-hell-of-nans-in-python-71b12558895b)
All NaNs are not equal. Some are butter NaNs.
```
>>> np.nan in [np.nan]
True

>>> np.nan == np.nan
False

>>> np.nan in [np.nan]
True

```
